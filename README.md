# Plant-Disease-Identifier

PROBLEM STATEMENT
To improve the process of predicting plant disease through machine learning model.
It is simpler and better to learn about the plant that is affected in a short amount of time with better prediction and with fewer side effects in order to improve the process of forecasting plant diseases.
MOTIVATION 
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth. In country like India, the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximise their yield, reduce spread of disease and loss in revenue.

ABOUT PROJECT
- In this project, I present a website in which a Plant disease identifier application is implemented.
-The plant disease prediction application, the user can input an image of a diseased plant leaf, and the application will predict what disease it is and will also give a little background about the disease and suggestions to cure it.

Dataset from which we trained the model to identify plant diseases is
- [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

How to use 
- Navigate down to the Disease identifier in website 
- Upload an image of the leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.

Note that, for now it only supports following crops
- Apple
- Blueberry
- Cherry
- Corn
- Grape
- Pepper
- Orange
- Peach
- Potato
- Soybean
- Strawberry
- Tomato
- Squash
- Raspberry
